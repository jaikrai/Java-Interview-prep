 - Java provides Hashtable, hashset and hashMap build-in data structures
 - generally you will use a hashMap because it provides the most flexibility and best performance
 - Hash maps use key-value pairs and hashing function to store organize their data
 - A hashing function maps a key or objet to specific hash
 - hash determines where the object is stored
 - As long as you have the key, retrieving the object is fast
